Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the application:
```sh
python src/app.py
```

Left to do:
- Output the tables for the node and edge sampling algorithms
- Build the "reconstructed" graph for each type (note they'll all be different)
- Report section describing my own experimental observations based on varying parameters and comparing them to whatever's actually used in the realworld
- Advancements in IP traceback mechanisms since the original paper
